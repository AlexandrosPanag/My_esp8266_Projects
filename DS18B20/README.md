What is a DS18B20 Temperature Sensor?
The DS18B20 is one type of temperature sensor and it supplies 9-bit to 12-bit readings of temperature. These values show the temperature of a particular device. The communication of this sensor can be done through a one-wire bus protocol which uses one data line to communicate with an inner microprocessor. Additionally, this sensor gets the power supply directly from the data line so that the need for an external power supply can be eliminated. The applications of the DS18B20 temperature sensor include industrial systems, consumer products, systems which are sensitive thermally, thermostatic controls, and thermometers.
