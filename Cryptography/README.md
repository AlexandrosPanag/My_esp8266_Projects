This is an edit to the code to make more sense for less experienced users

Original code description : 
This example demonstrates the usage of the ESP8266 Crypto implementation, which aims to contain easy-to-use cryptographic functions.
Crypto is currently primarily a frontend for the cryptographic library BearSSL which is used by `BearSSL::WiFiClientSecure` and `BearSSL::WiFiServerSecure` in the ESP8266 Arduino Core.
   Extensive documentation can be found in the Crypto source code files and on the [BearSSL homepage](https://www.bearssl.org).
