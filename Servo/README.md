These Projects were based on the book "ARDUINO ΑΛΓΟΡΙΘΜΙΚΗ, ΠΡΟΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΙΣΜΟΣ ΚΑΙ ΕΦΑΡΜΟΓΕΣ" by Αριστείδης Σ. Μπούρας και Γιάννης Θ. Κάππος.

These code was run on Tower Pro MG90S Micro Servo module

Servo
-------

We connect the esp pin 4 with the orange cable servo cable, the 3v power source with the servo source red cable and the G with the gnd servo ground black cable


This project makes the servo do a clock spin of 180 degrees and then resets it when it reaches it


Servo with Potensiometer
--------

We use the potensiometer in order to set the value of the servo , depending on how we turn the potensiometer the servo will turn.
