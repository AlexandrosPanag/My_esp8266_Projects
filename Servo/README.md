Servo
-------

This code was run on Tower Pro MG90S Micro Servo module. We connect the esp pin 4 with the orange cable servo cable, the 3v power source with the servo source red cable and the G with the gnd servo ground black cable


This project makes the servo do a clock spin of 180 degrees and then resets it when it reaches it
